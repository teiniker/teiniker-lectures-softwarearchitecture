# Software Architectures by Examples
Software Architectures is a huge topic which is mainly discussed in theory. 
This project collects examples for the most common architectural patterns. 
You can find examples for the following software architectural styles:

1. [Layered Architecture](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarearchitectures/tree/master/layered)
  * Data Access Object (DAO)
  * Service Layer
  * Model-View-Controller (incl. Front Controller and View Helper)
  * Dependency Injection
  * Remote Facade
  * Data Transfer Object (DTO)
  
2. [Component-Based Architectures](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarearchitectures/tree/master/component-based) 
  * Component & Container
  * Session Component
  * Instance Pooling 

3. [Service-Oriented Architectures](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarearchitectures/tree/master/services)
  * RPC API Stype
  * Resource API Stype
  * Consumer-Driven Contracts
  * API Gateway

Finally, a section related to [Java Web Programming](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarearchitectures/tree/master/web-applications)
can be found.
