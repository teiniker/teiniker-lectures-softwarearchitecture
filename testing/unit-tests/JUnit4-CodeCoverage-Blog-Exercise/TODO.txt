Exercise: Code Coverage
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For the given classes "Blog", "Post" and "IntegerSequence", the 
following test classes should be extended to reach a 100% code
coverage (line coverage):
	- IntegerSequenceTest
	- PostTest
	- BlogTest
	
Note that we use a test stub named "PostTableStub" for the
given "PostTable" interface.
